## General Introduction
École Centrale Casablanca prepares future leaders by immersing them in concrete projects that confront them with current and future economic challenges. By focusing on advanced technologies, students develop innovative solutions to address contemporary issues.

The "Learning By Doing" project perfectly illustrates this educational approach. It is a collaborative work where students, supervised by a tutor, design an ambitious project around the theme of the smart city in Africa. This third edition focuses on smart solutions for urban traffic management. The project spans two semesters, allowing students to develop their skills in project management, applied research, and prototyping.

## Presentation of the Idea
### Problematic
Traffic jams are a recurring problem that significantly impacts urban mobility. Whether caused by accidents, poor traffic light management, or inefficient road infrastructure, these slowdowns result in considerable time loss, excessive fuel consumption, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.

### Proposed Solution
One of the most effective solutions to reduce traffic jams is optimizing the synchronization of traffic lights. By adapting the operation of lights in real-time according to traffic, it is possible to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion.

Our project aims to design an intelligent traffic light management system based on artificial intelligence and IoT. It will:
- Collect real-time traffic data via sensors and cameras.
- Analyze this data to dynamically adjust traffic light cycles.
- Reduce waiting times at intersections while ensuring user safety.

## Action Plan
1. **Research and Analysis**: Study existing solutions, identify limitations, and define the project's technical specifications.
2. **Prototype Design**: Develop a functional model integrating sensors and optimization algorithms.
3. **Testing and Improvements**: Experiment in a simulated environment, adjust parameters, and validate the system.
4. **Presentation of Results**: Document performance and demonstrate the prototype.

## Conclusion
This project is fully in line with the educational approach of École Centrale Casablanca by combining technological innovation and experiential learning. It allows students to tackle real-world problems and propose concrete solutions to improve urban mobility in Africa.
